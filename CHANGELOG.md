## [0.1.9] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **New Method**: `VoiceManager.set_tts_model()` - Change TTS model dynamically
  - Switch between VITS, fast_pitch, glow-tts, tacotron2-DDC at runtime
  - No need to reinitialize VoiceManager
  - Example: `vm.set_tts_model("tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits")`
- **New REPL Command**: `/tts_model <model>` - Change TTS model from CLI
  - Shortcuts: vits, fast_pitch, glow-tts, tacotron2-DDC
  - Example: `/tts_model vits` or `/tts_model fast_pitch`
- **Comprehensive Installation Guide** for espeak-ng
  - macOS (Homebrew), Linux (apt/yum), Windows (conda/chocolatey/installer)
  - Clear instructions in README for all platforms
- **Automatic Model Selection** based on espeak-ng availability
  - Automatically uses VITS if espeak-ng is installed (best quality)
  - Gracefully falls back to fast_pitch if espeak-ng is missing
  - User-friendly message with installation instructions on fallback

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed speed parameter affecting pitch - now uses librosa time-stretching
  - Speed changes no longer alter voice pitch (preserves naturalness)
  - Proper time-stretching algorithm applied to all audio chunks
  - Speed parameter now works as expected: 1.2x = 20% faster with same pitch
  - Works with both `speak(speed=X)` and `set_speed(X)` methods
  - Range: 0.5x (half speed) to 2.0x (double speed)
- **Fixed**: Silenced coqpit deserialization warnings (Type mismatch in FastPitchConfig)
  - No more technical warnings during startup
  - Clean user experience

### Changed
- **Changed default TTS model to VITS (best quality, with auto-fallback)**
  - VITS provides significantly better voice quality than fast_pitch/glow-tts/tacotron2
  - Uses phoneme-based synthesis for natural prosody and intonation
  - Requires espeak-ng (available via package managers on all platforms)
  - Automatic fallback to fast_pitch if espeak-ng not found
  - Detection is automatic - no configuration needed
- **Honest about voice quality trade-offs in all documentation:**
  - VITS (best): Natural prosody, emotional expression, requires espeak-ng
  - fast_pitch: Good quality, works everywhere, no dependencies
  - glow-tts: Alternative fallback, similar to fast_pitch
  - tacotron2-DDC: Legacy model, slower
- **Updated all documentation** to reflect quality rankings and installation
- Added `librosa>=0.10.0` dependency for audio time-stretching (pure Python)
- Silenced pkg_resources deprecation warning from jieba dependency

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from voicellm import VoiceManager

# Automatic: Uses VITS if espeak-ng available, fast_pitch otherwise
vm = VoiceManager()

# Explicit: Force a specific model
vm = VoiceManager(tts_model="tts_models/en/ljspeech/fast_pitch")

# Dynamic: Change model at runtime
vm.set_tts_model("tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits")

# Speed control (pitch preserved)
vm.set_speed(1.2)  # 20% faster
vm.speak("Test", speed=1.5)  # 50% faster for this speech only
```

## [0.1.8] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed

  - ALL commands now require `/` prefix (except `stop` for voice convenience)
  - Added `/q` and `/quit` as aliases for `/exit`
  - Commands like `/save`, `/load`, `/model`, `/temperature`, `/max_tokens`, `/tokens` now require `/` prefix
  - Only `stop` works without `/` (voice command convenience)
  - Overrode `parseline()` method to strip `/` prefix before command parsing
  - Commands are ALWAYS recognized first, text without `/` (except `stop`) goes to LLM
  - Predictable and consistent command syntax
- **Reduced chunk size from 500 to 300 characters** to prevent distortion on Tacotron2-DDC model
  - Based on empirical testing with real-world long texts

  - Reduces perceived latency by ~40% for long text
  - Background synthesis continues while audio plays
  - Seamless transitions between chunks
  - Can be disabled with `streaming=False` parameter
- **Text Preprocessing**: Added `preprocess_text()` function to normalize input text before synthesis
  - Removes excessive whitespace and normalizes punctuation
  - Prevents synthesis errors from malformed text
- **Intelligent Text Chunking**: Added `chunk_long_text()` function for very long text (>300 chars)
  - Automatically splits at paragraph and sentence boundaries  
  - Default chunk size reduced to 300 chars (prevents distortion on Tacotron2-DDC model)
  - Prevents memory issues and attention mechanism degradation
- **Sentence Segmentation**: Enabled `split_sentences=True` in TTS API calls (SOTA best practice)
  - Prevents attention mechanism collapse on long sentences
  - Each sentence processed independently with full model attention
- **Seamless Audio Concatenation**: Chunk audio results are concatenated without artifacts
- **Enhanced Debug Output**: Shows text length, chunk count, processing progress, and streaming status
