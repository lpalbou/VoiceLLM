## Notice

This acknowledgment file aims to properly credit the open-source projects used in VoiceLLM. If you believe a project is missing or improperly attributed, please open an issue or contact the maintainers.

When using VoiceLLM, be aware that some of the underlying dependencies may have different licensing terms than VoiceLLM itself. While VoiceLLM is licensed under MIT, users should review the licenses of the dependencies if they intend to use them independently or in ways that may conflict with their respective licenses.

For example, some TTS models may have non-commercial use restrictions. If you plan to use VoiceLLM in a commercial application, you should ensure you are using models that permit commercial use or obtain appropriate licenses.
